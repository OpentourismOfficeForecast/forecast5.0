# Lenzerheide Tourist Office Forecasting
This code was developed during the Open Data Hackdays: Tourism in Lucenre
The challenge proposed by the tourist offices of Lenzerheide and Arosa was to predict the number of client contacts for each day.
More details on the challenge can be found [here](https://hack.opendata.ch/project/375)
## Idea
The Idea was, to develop a machine learning model based on historic data to predict the contacts for the future.
## Implementation
Data exploration was done partly in R and Python.
Neural networks and XGBoost were used as learning algorithms. Without much tuning XGBoost performed better and most of the tuning was done with this approach.
